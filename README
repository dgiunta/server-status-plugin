ServerStatus
============

This plugin adds a Server Status Controller and views to support displaying which server this app is running on.

After installing the plugin in the vendor/plugins/server_status directory, add the following line to config/routes.rb:

  map.connect "server_status/:action/:id", :controller => "server_status"

Then, going to "http://host/server_status" will display the hostname of the server this app is running on.
